# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview

Based off the city data and rider data files, we analyzed data for the companys profits. The following deliverables were needed in the module:

#### The mean, median, and mode for the following:

  * The total number of rides for each city type.
  * The average fares for each city type.
  * The total number of drivers for each city type

#### Box and whisker plots to determine outliers.

  * The number of rides for each city type.
  * The fares for each city type.
  * The number of drivers for each city type.

#### Pie chart to show the following data:

  * The percent of total fares.
  * The percent of total rides.
  * The percent of total drivers.
 
#### A bubble chart that shows the average fare vs the total number of rides with the bubble size changing depending on the total number of drivers for a specific city type.

## Challenge

**Using Pandas and Matplotlib we created one multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type** 

The following deliverables were required to complete the challenge:

This graph shows consistentcy throughout it. Urban cities bring in the most money following the subarban and lastly the rural citites.
