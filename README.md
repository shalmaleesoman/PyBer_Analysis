#### The mean, median, and mode for the following:

  * The total number of rides for each city type.
  * The average fares for each city type.
  * The total number of drivers for each city type

#### Box and whisker plots to determine outliers.

  * The number of rides for each city type.
  * The fares for each city type.
  * The number of drivers for each city type.

#### Pie chart to show the following data:

  * The percent of total fares.
  * The percent of total rides.
  * The percent of total drivers.
 
#### A bubble chart that shows the average fare vs the total number of rides with the bubble size changing depending on the total number of drivers for a specific city type.
